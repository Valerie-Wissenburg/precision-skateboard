        <p>If you ask most people, they’ll tell you that Precision Skateboards started in 1986. If you ask the right people, they’ll tell you that Precision Skateboards was founded in January of 1984 by Scott Bouwens. The shop was in his basement, he ran it by himself, and he coined the name of the shop inspired by Precision Bearings, another business in town.
</p>
		<p>Then in the summer of 1986 Phil Burcher joined Scott, and together they moved  to a legitimate location at 19th and ‘O’ Street in the heart of downtown Lincoln, Nebraska, which they consider to be the real birth of the shop. With a minuscule 175 square feet Precision Skateboards began to support and grow the Lincoln skate scene. Precision Skateboards has remained the only locally owned and operated Skate shop in Lincoln.

        <h2>Growing Pains</h2>
    </header>
    <div class="small-11 medium-6 large-8 columns">
        <p>With the boom of skateboarding in the late 80, Precision Skateboards grew. They began sponsoring local skaters, and putting on demos, and contests multiple times a year. Growing the local scene and helping kids to find the joy in skateboarding were their only goals. Precision Skateboards provided a place for skateboarders to feel at home, and a place to feel welcomed. They carried the best products the industry had to offer.

</p>
		<p>When the bubble burst in the early 90s, and skateboarding lost its public glamor, times got hard. Their original location was demolished, and Precision Skateboards was forced to move to its second location a few blocks down. While other skate shops closing nation wide, Precision Skateboards tightened their belts, and held fast to their love of the sport, and continued to support their local scene the best they could. With that perseverance, Precision Skateboards has become one of the oldest skate shops in the world, with only a few shops in California where skateboarding was born that were also able to survive the skate recession.

      <h2> Moving Forward</h2>
    </header>
	<div class="small-11 medium-6 large-6 columns">
		<p>The partnership between Precision Skateboards and The Bay continued to blossom when the two left the mall and moved into their present location at 2005 Y street, back to Downtown Lincoln. With more space than ever before, and a skatepark right outside their door, Precision has entered their golden age, bringing in big name companies, and putting on events multiple times a year. Approaching 30 years of business, Precision Skateboards is looking toward the future, trying to grow their brand, and give back to the skate community as much as they can. Partnering with The Bay and other local organizations like UNL and the food bank to incorporate skateboarding into daily activities has given the skateshop countless opportunities to expose people to skateboarding and the positive effect it can have on an individual. </p>
